// In this Kata we are passing a number (n) into a function.
// Your code will determine if the number passed is even (or not).
// The function needs to return either a true or false.
// Numbers may be positive or negative, integers or floats.
// Floats with decimal part non equal to zero are considered UNeven for this kata.

// The museum of incredibly dull things
// The museum of incredibly dull things wants to get rid of some exhibits. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibits. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.

// However, just as she finished rating all exhibits, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the exhibits after removing the lowest one. Fair enough.

// Task
// Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with the lowest index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

// Don't change the order of the elements that are left.

// Examples
// * Input: [1,2,3,4,5], output = [2,3,4,5]
// * Input: [5,3,2,1,4], output = [5,3,2,4]
// * Input: [2,2,1,2,1], output = [2,2,2,1]
